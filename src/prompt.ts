Prompt: The Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) provides university students with practical work experience to complement their academic learning. As part of this program, students must maintain a logbook documenting their daily activities in the workplace over a six-month period. At the end of the internship, they must submit both the logbook and a detailed report analyzing projects and tasks completed.

Task: Given the business name, a description of its operations, an overview of the project assigned to the student, and some example activities, generate a realistic five-day logbook entry outlining the tasks performed each day which will be as a json payload. The response should follow the standard workweek format (Monday-Friday) and provide structured descriptions of the student's work as a JSON array.

For example: 
{businessName: "Sifax Productions Limited", businessDescription: "Sifax constructs affordable residential apartments in Nigeria", projectName: "Building a 3 bedroom apartment in Isolo Nigeria", additionalContext: "Introductory week of siwes internship for a civil engineering student"}

Additional Context: If further details are required to enhance accuracy (such as industry type, department, or specific skills involved), specify what additional information is needed
